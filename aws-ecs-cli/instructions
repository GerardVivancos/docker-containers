Edit the credentials file in the .aws/ directory to include your AK/SK combination.
Don't edit the config file since EC2-CS is only available at the NV region endpoint.
Then build the image with:
	docker build [-t repo/name] .
Run a container from it:
	docker run [--name container-name] -t -i {image-id | repo/name}  
This should give you a prompt to the container. Test the cli by running:
	aws ecs list-clusters
Feel free to reconfigure credentials and stuff. Changes will stay as long as you don't rm the container:
	aws config
Exit the container with a simple:
	exit
You can run it again with:
	docker start -a -i {container-name | container-id}
